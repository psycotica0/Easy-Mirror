This is a few scripts to build a quick chroot mirror of your whole system.
It allows you to build up a mirror, enter into it, and then break it down.

They all need to be run as root.

So:

sudo ./build_mirror
This makes a file called cache.img.
It then mounts it to /mnt/cache and /mnt/union.
If cache.img exists, it mounts it.

sudo ./enter_mirror
This logs you in to the new image.

sudo ./breakdown_mirror
This unmounts all the areas.
It does not delete cache.img
You can do whatever you want with cache.img


Tip:
I tend to change .bashrc when I make a new image to put CHROOT in the PS1.
That way I can tell when I'm in and when I'm not.
