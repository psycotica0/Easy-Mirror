This is a few scripts to build a quick chroot mirror of your whole system.
It allows you to build up a mirror, enter into it, and then break it down.

They all need to be run as root.

So:

sudo build_mirror test.img
This makes a file called test.img.
It mounts it to /mnt/easy_mirror/test/cache.
Then it makes a union between that and / at /mnt/easy_mirror/test/union.
If test.img already existed, then it's used as is.
Otherwise a new, empty, one is created.

sudo enter_mirror
This logs you in to the new image.
If you have more than one mounted at a time, then you'll need to specify.
sudo enter_mirror test

sudo breakdown_mirror
This attempts to cleanly unmount the mirror
It does not delete the image file (test.img).
If you have more than one mounted at a time, then you'll need to specify.
sudo breakdown_mirror test


Tip:
I tend to change .bashrc when I make a new image to put CHROOT in the PS1.
That way I can tell when I'm in and when I'm not.
